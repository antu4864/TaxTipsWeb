        <div className="container">

            <p>
              Donations to charity from individuals are tax-free. You can get
              tax relief if you donate through Gift Aid or, through Payroll
              Giving, straight from your wages or pension.
              <br />
              <br />
              If you pay Income Tax above the 20% basic rate you can claim back
              the difference between the tax you've paid on the donation and
              what the charity got back.
              <br />
              <br />
              Your tax-free allowance may increase if you make donations through
              Gift Aid and claim Married Couple's Allowance.
              <br />
              <br />
              If your employer or pension provider offers a Payroll Giving
              scheme, any donations you give through the scheme will be taken
              before Income Tax is taken off.
              <br />
              <br />
              You'll still pay National Insurance contributions on the amount of
              your donation. But you won't pay any Income Tax on the amount you
              donate.
            </p>
            <h3>1. Always record your donations.</h3>
            <p>
              Keep a careful record of all donations that you make during a tax
              year, including details of the dates, amounts, and the charity to
              which they are made. Where possible, obtain a receipt at the time.
              <br />
              <br />
              Failure to retain all relevant documentation will make it harder
              to evidence your claim for a tax-allowable deduction, should HMRC
              enquire into your charitable donations.{" "}
            </p>
            <h3>2. Donations to individuals.</h3>
            <p>
              Remember donations made to individuals (not via a charity) will
              not attract tax relief.
            </p>
            <h3>Note:</h3>
