    <h2>Corporation Tax</h2>
        <div className="container">
          <div>
              <p>Corporation Tax is the tax that a company pays on the profits that it makes.<br/><br/>
It should not be forgotten that a corporate structure can be tax efficient. Profits generated in
 accounting periods starting on or after 1st April 2017 are subject to a 19% Corporation Tax charge.</p>
<h3>Note:</h3>
<p>In March 2021 the Chancellor announced the UK rate of Corporation Tax will increase to 25%, to support the UK post COVID recovery. The increase will not take effect until 2023.<br/><br/>
Businesses with profits of up to £50,000 will continue to be taxed at 19%.<br/><br/>
A tapered rate will also be introduced for profits above £50,000, so that only businesses with profits of £250,000 or greater will be taxed at the full 25% rate.</p>
<h3>1. Claim for all business expenses.</h3>
<p>It is not uncommon for a director (or employee, for that matter) to spend money on behalf of the business, and to forget or not get around to claiming it back from the company.</p>
<h3>2. Timing is everything.</h3>
<p>If you are planning to invest in capital items for your company, ensure that you get your timing right and that you claim your full capital allowance entitlement.</p>
<h3>3. Owner / manager - remuneration.</h3>
<p>If you are an owner/manager of the company, you can take a combination of salary and dividends out of your business. Your personal circumstances and business performance will dictate the optimum split between salary and dividends that will minimise corporation and personal taxes.</p>
<h3>4. Research and development.</h3>
<p>There are different types of R&D tax relief depending on the size of your company and whether the project has been subcontracted.<br/><br/>

A small and medium sized R&D tax relief scheme is available to those with less than 500 staff and turn over under 100m euros or with a balance sheet value under 86m euros.<br/><br/>

You may need to include linked companies and partnerships when you I work out if you're a SME.<br/><br/>

SME R&D relief allows companies to:<br/><br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• deduct an extra 130% of their qualifying costs from their yearly profit, as well as the normal 100% deduction, to make a total 230% deduction;<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• claim a tax credit if the company is loss making, worth up to 14.5% of the surrenderable loss.<br/><br/>
The Research and Development Expenditure Credit (RDEC) gets Corporation Tax relief on your company's research and development costs.</p>
<h3>5. Claim your business-related mileage.</h3>
<p>If you use your private car for trips that are 100% business-related, you can recover the cost of your mileage - either from your company, or against your end-of-year income tax liability using HMRC's authorised mileage rates.<br/><br/>
Where your company provides you with a car but expects you to pay for all of the fuel used, and where you use your company car for trips that are 100% business related, you can claim the cost of your fuel consumed either from your company or against your end-of-year income tax liability using HMRC's advisory. mileage rates.</p>
