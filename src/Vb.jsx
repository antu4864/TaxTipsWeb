              The provision of company cars gives rise to taxable 'benefit in
              kind' forms as well as a charge to Class 1A National Insurance on
              the value of the car benefit.
              <br />
              <br />
              You'll pay tax if you or your family use a company car privately,
              including for commuting.
              <br />
              <br />
              The tax on the value of the company car will depend on things like
              how much it would cost to buy and the type of fuel it uses.
              <br />
              <br />
              This value of the car is reduced if:
              <br />
              <br />
              • you have it part-time;
              <br />
              <br />
              • you pay something towards its cost; and/or
              <br />
              <br />
              • it has low CO2 emissions.
              <br />
              <br />
              If your employer pays for fuel you use for personal journeys,
              you'll pay tax on this separately.
              <h3>
                1. Select a new company car with a lower emissions rating.
              </h3>
              Not only will you feel good that you are doing your bit for the
              environment, but you will also that your taxable benefit is much
              lower.
              <h3>
                2. If you have low private mileage, reimburse the full cost of
                private fuel.
              </h3>
              With HMRC's extremely high benefit in kind charges, if your
              private mileage is low, it is more tax-efficient for both you and
              your employer if you either:
              <br />
              <br />
              • reimburse your employer for your private usage of a company car,
              using actual costs incurred or HMRC advisory fuel rates; or,
              <br />
              <br />• you pay the full cost of fuel consumed by your company car
              and then make a claim using HMRC advisory fuel rates.
