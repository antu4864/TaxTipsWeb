<p>A pension is a long-term tax-efficient savings plan - a way to save money during your working life to help fund you in your retirement.<br/><br/>

It is just a tax-free pot of cash you, your employer (and sometimes the Government) pays into, as a way of saving up for your retirement. At retirement, you can draw money from your pension pot or sell the cash to an insurance company in return for a regular income until death, called an annuity.<br/><br/>

Some pension schemes are run by employers; others you can manage yourself. You can even save into more than one pension scheme at the same time.<br/><br/>


As a general rule, if you are a UK-resident taxpayer under the age of 75, you can contribute to your pension as much as you earn each year, up to the annual allowance of £40,000.<br/><br/>
If you are not earning enough to pay income tax, you can still receive tax relief on pension contributions up to a maximum of £3,600 a year.</p>
<h3>Tax relief</h3>
<p>You can get tax relief on private pension contributions up to 100% of your annual earnings.<br/><br/>

You get the tax relief automatically if:<br/><br/>

• Your employer takes workplace pension contributions out of your pay before deducting Income Tax.<br/><br/>

• You pay tax at 20% where your pension provider claims a tax credit and adds it to your pension pot ('relief at source').</p>
<h3>Additional tax relief in England, Wales and Northern Ireland:</h3>
<p>You can claim additional tax relief under Self Assessment, of:<br/><br/>

• A further 20% if you pay Income Tax at 40%.<br/><br/>
 • A further 25% if you pay Income Tax at 45%.

<h3>Additional tax relief in relief in Scotland</h3>

You can claim additional tax relief under Self Assessment, of:<br/><br/>

• 1% if you pay Income Tax at 21%.<br/><br/>

• 21% if you pay Income Tax at 41%.<br/><br/>

• 26% if you pay Income Tax at 46%.

<h3>Note:</h3>
• If your rate of Income Tax in Scotland is 19% your pension provider will still claim tax relief for you at a rate of 20%, you do not need to repay the difference.<br/><br/>

• You get relief at source in all personal and stakeholder pensions, and some workplace pensions.<br/><br/>

• UK tax relief is also available on contributions made

to certain types of overseas pension schemes.<br/><br/>

If you're getting tax relief on pension contributions worth more than 100% of your annual earnings. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) can ask you to pay back anything over this limit.

<h3>Lifetime allowance for pension savings</h3>

The lifetime allowance is a limit on the value of pay outs from your pension scheme, whether lump sums or retirement income, that can be made without triggering an extra tax charge.<br/><br/>

It applies to the total of all the pensions you have, including the value of pensions promised through any defined benefit scheme(s) you belong to, but excluding your State Pension.<br/><br/>

The standard Lifetime Allowance is indexed annually in line with the Consumer Prices Index (CPI).<br/><br/>

The lifetime allowance for most people is currently £1,073,100.

<h3>The annual allowance </h3>
The annual allowance is a limit on the amount that can be contributed to your pension each year, while still receiving tax relief. It's based on your earnings for the year and is capped at £40,000.<br/><br/>

It applies across all of the schemes you belong to and includes all contributions that you or your employer or anyone else pays on your behalf.<br/><br/>

A lower limit of £4,000 may apply if you have already started accessing your pension.

<h3>If you exceed the allowance</h3>

If you exceed the annual allowance in a year, you won't receive tax relief on any contributions paid that exceed the limit and you will be faced with an annual allowance charge.<br/><br/>

The annual allowance charge will be added to the rest of your taxable income for the tax year in question when determining your tax liability.<br/><br/>

If the annual allowance charge is more than £2,000, you can ask your pension scheme to pay the charge from your benefits.<br/><br/>

Unless you have a money purchase annual allowance (MPAA), you may be able to bring forward any unused annual allowances from the previous three tax years, to either reduce your annual allowance charge to a lower amount or reduce the annual allowance charge completely.    
 <h3>Changes to the annual allowance - the Money Purchase Annual Allowance (MPAA)</h3> 
 Introduced in April 2015, the MPAA is currently £4,000<br/><br/>

gross p.a.<br/><br/>

• The MPAA applies if you have withdrawn more than the 25% tax free pension commencement lump sum.<br/><br/>

• The MPAA only starts to apply from the day after you have taken flexible benefits and so any previous savings are not affected.<br/><br/>

• You cannot bring forward any unused annual allowances from the previous three tax years to warrant a higher contribution than £4,000 towards your defined contribution benefits.

<h3>The Tapered Annual Allowance</h3>

The tapered annual allowance came into force as of 6 April 2016 for high earners.<br/><br/>

• For every £2 of income above £200,000 per annum, £1 of annual allowance will be lost.<br/><br/>

• The maximum reduction will be £36,000 meaning that anyone earning over £240,000 will have their annual allowance capped at £4,000.<br/><br/>

• An income floor will mean the taper will not apply unless the individual's income excluding pension contributions exceeds £200,000 (the threshold income).
 <h3>Charges if you exceed the lifetime allowance</h3>  
 If the cumulative value of the pay-outs from your pension pots, including the value of the pay-outs from any defined benefit schemes, exceeds the lifetime allowance, there will be a tax on the excess, called the lifetime allowance charge.<br/><br/>

The way the charge applies depends on whether you receive the money from your pension as a lump sum or as part of regular retirement income.

<h3>Lump sums</h3>

Any amount over your lifetime allowance that you take as a lump sum is taxed at 55%.<br/><br/>

Your pension scheme administrator should deduct the tax and pay it over to HMRC, paying the balance to you.

<h3>Other points</h3>

<h3>1. Give your children or grandchildren a helping hand.</h3>

If you have children, grandchildren, nephews, or nieces, why not take advantage of the UK government's generosity by putting money into their own children's pension?<br/><br/>

Money put into a child's pension gets the same tax relief as any other pension. So, even though your child is not a taxpayer, the taxman will add 20% to payments made, up to a maximum £3,600 each tax year (£2,880 of relatives' contributions and £720 in tax relief). 
<h3>2. Have you lost track of your pension(s)?</h3>

Most of us will have worked for a number of employers over the years, and it can be easy to lose track of old pensions. You can find old pensions through the Pension Tracing Service.

<h3>3. Are you aware of the 2015 Pension Reforms?</h3>

Changes in April 2015 have removed the need to buy an annuity to provide income until you die, giving access to invest-and-drawdown schemes previously restricted to wealthier savers. The 55 percent 'death tax' on pension pots left invested has also been axed.<br/><br/>

These changes apply to people with 'defined contribution' pensions who invest them in order to receive a pot of money at retirement. They don't apply to those with guaranteed final salary pensions.
