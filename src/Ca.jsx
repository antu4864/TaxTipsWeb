    <h2>Capital Allowances</h2>
        <div className="container">
          <div>
          
              <p>Capital allowances concern the write-off for tax purposes of expenditure on capital items such as fixed assets
                (computers, desk, machinery). The rate of write off against taxable profits is determined by government policy.</p>
            <p>Under certain circumstances, you may be able to write off the entire cost of your capital expenditure against your taxable profits in the year of purchase.
                 For example, if you are a small business which has acquired new computers.</p>
                 <h3>There should always be a commercial reason.</h3>
                 <p>Only spend money to acquire an asset for your business if there is a genuine commercial need.</p>
                 <h3>Timing is everything.</h3>
                 <p>If there is a genuine commercial need for a new fixed asset, you can access the funds required for a purchase and you can put it to use as soon as it is acquired. It is best to acquire the asset prior to the end of one accounting period,
                      rather than to defer the decision until the start of the next.</p>
                 <p>Even if you only hold an asset for a short period of time prior to the end of an accounting period, you will be able to start immediately writing off the asset - thereby lowering your taxable profits in the current year.</p>
                <h3>Sometimes you may even be able to claim a 100% write-off.</h3>
                <p>Expenditure on plant and machinery, attracts a 100% first-year allowance, which means you can deduct the full cost of the asset from your business's profit, no matter how much it has cost.</p>
                <h3>Super deduction</h3>
                <p>For capital expenditure incurred from 1 April 2021 until the end of March 2023, companies can claim 130% capital allowances on qualifying plant and machinery investments.<br/><br/>
                Under the super-deduction, for every pound a company invests, their taxes are cut by up to 25p.</p>
                <h3>Annual Investment Allowance (AIA)</h3>
                <p>The Annual Investment Allowance (AIA) provides businesses with 100% tax relief, in the year of purchase.<br/><br/>
                 The 100% AIA amount for expenditure on plant and machinery (P&M) was temporarily increased from £200,000 to £1 million from 1 January 2019. It was due to decrease to £200,000 from January 202. However, in November 2020 it was announced that, to stimulate investment in UK manufacturing and support business
                  confidence, the £1 million annual allowance would remain in place untril 1 January 2022.</p>
                  <h3>Who can claim AIA?</h3>
                  <p>The allowance is open to many entities so long as their business activity meets one of the following criteria: trading; commercial property letting; office employment; or leasing.<br/><br/>
                    AIAs are not available to mixed partnerships (that is, partnerships comprised of both individuals and companies).</p>
                    <h3>Structures and Buildings Allowance</h3>
                    A new Structures and Buildings Allowance (SBA) has been introduced for qualifying expenditure incurred on or after 29 October 2018.<br/><br/>
                    The relief is available from when the structure or building is brought into use for the first time for a qualifying activity.<br/><br/>
From April 2020 the rate of allowance has been 3%.<br/><br/>
The allowance is given on a straight-line basis for a 50 year period. It applies to qualifying expenditure incurred on or after 29 October 2018.
