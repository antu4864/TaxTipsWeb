<p>National Insurance contributions (NICs) help to pay for some state benefits, including retirement pensions. The NICs that you pay can earn you the right to receive certain benefits.<br/><br/>

There are currently four different classes on national insurance.<br/><br/>

The class of NICs you pay is dependent upon whether you are employed, self-employed, or making voluntary contributions.</p>
<h3>1. National Insurance for the self-employed.</h3>
<p>Class 2 NICs are calculated on the number of full, or partial, weeks of self-employment in a given tax year where your profits for that tax year equal or exceed the £6,515 Small Profits Threshold (£6,475, 2020/21).<br/><br/>

A flat rate of £3.05 per week (£3.05, 2020/21) is payable in one lump sum no later than 31 January following the tax year concerned.<br/><br/>

Where your profits are below the Small Profits Threshold, and where there is a risk that you may not have made enough NICs to guarantee that you will receive a full state pension upon retirement, it could be advisable to make Class 2 NICS - even though you would be otherwise entitled to claim an exemption.<br/><br/>
Paying class 2 NICS is a cheaper way to ensure that you maintain your State Pension entitlement than opting to pay Class 3 voluntary NICS.<br/><br/>

Class 4 NICs are paid by the self-employed on net profits that are subject to income tax.<br/><br/>

Class 4 NICs are payable at a rate of 9% on profits between the Lower Profits Limit of £9,568 (£9,500, 2019/20) and Upper Profits Limit £50,270 (£50,000, 2020/21) and 2% on profits above £50,000 (£50,000, 2020/21).    </p>
<h3>2. Going abroad to work?</h3>
<p>If you are going abroad to work, you can elect to pay Class 2 NICs. That way, you get the same State Pension entitlement as if though you were paying Class 3 NICs (see below), but at a fraction of the cost.<br/><br/>

Before deciding whether to pay NICS voluntarily, you should make sure that there are gaps in your NI record for which payment can be made to enhance your State Pension Entitlement.<br/><br/>

If you are unsure about any gaps in your National Insurance record, speak to us as we can advise on what is best for you.</p>
<h3>3. Voluntary contributions</h3>
<p>You may be able to pay Class 3 voluntary National Insurance to fill gaps in your contributions record to qualify for benefits like the State Pension.<br/><br/>

Class 3 NICs are charged at a rate of £15.40 (£15.30, 2020/21) per week and are normally paid quarterly within the tax year concerned.

<h3>Before you pay</h3>

Check your National Insurance record to find out:

if you have any gaps;

if you're eligible to pay voluntary contributions; and

• how much it will cost.

<h3>Note:</h3>

Navigating your way around the complexity of UK tax and National Insurance rules is challenging.<br/><br/>
