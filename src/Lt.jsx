            <h3>1. England and Northern Ireland.</h3>
            <p>
              Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) is payable if you buy a property or
              land in England and Northern Ireland above a certain threshold.
              <br />
              <br />
              The 2021/22 SDLT threshold is £500,000 for residential properties
              until 30 June 2021. Rising to £250,000 until 30 September. Then it
              will revert to its pre-COVID level of £125,000.
              <br />
              The threshold for non-residential land and properties is £150,000.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Scotland.</h3>
            <p>
              Land and Building Transaction Tax (LBTT) is payable if you buy a
              property or land in Scotland above a certain threshold.
              <br />
              <br />
              The 2020/21 LBTT threshold is £145,000 (£175,000 for first time
              buyers) for residential properties and £150,000 for
              non-residential land and properties.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Wales.</h3>
            <p>
              Land Transaction Tax (LTT) is payable if you buy a property or
              land in Wales above a certain threshold.
              <br />
              <br />
              The 2020/21 LTT threshold is £250,000 for residential properties
              until 30 June 2021. Then it will revert to its pre-COVID level of
              £180,000.
              <br />
              <br />
              The threshold for non-residential land and properties is £150,000.{" "}
            </p>
            <h3>4. First time buyers.</h3>
            <p>
              There are different rules if you're buying your first home. You
              get a discount (relief) which means in many instances you pay less
              or nothing at all..
            </p>
            <h3>5. Second property.</h3>
            <p>
              Individuals and companies pay a higher rate of land tax (3%
              surcharge) when buying an additional residential property in
              England, Wales or Northern Ireland.
              <br />
              <br />
              In Scotland, the LBTT surcharge is 4%.
              <br />
              <br />
              The higher rate applies even if the other residential properties
              are outside of those in the UK.
            </p>
            <h3>6. Non-resident residential property purchases</h3>
            <p>
              From April 2021 an additional 2% surcharge is to be introduced for
              UK property purchases made by a non-UK resident.
              <br />
              <br />
              If applicable, this surcharge will be in addition to the surcharge
              for second homes.
            </p>

              7. Invest in commercial property and save the 3% additional SDLT
              charge.
            </h3>
            <p>
              If you already hold a good portfolio of residential buy-to-let
              properties, consider diversifying into commercial property. It is
              a way of spreading your investment risk, and avoiding the need to
              pay the 3% additional SDLT charge imposed on purchasers of
              additional residential properties.
            </p>
            <h3>8. Stamp Duty Land Tax for Enveloped Dwellings</h3>
            <p>
              SDLT is payable at the rate of 15% where a company acquires a
              dwelling costing more than £500,000.
              <br />
              <br />
              There is an exemption (so that only the normal, lower, rates of
              SDLT apply) for all genuine property businesses - covering (inter
              alia) property developers, investors and dealers.
              <br />
              <br />
              There are conditions to qualify for relief, the most notable being
              that no-one connected with the company lives in the property. This
              relief is not automatic: it needs to be recorded and claimed on
              the relevant SDLT Return.
              <br />
              <br />
              This relief is not automatic: it needs to be recorded and claimed
              on the relevant SDLT Return.

            <h3>Note:</h3>
            <p>
              HMRC and successive Chancellors have been cracking down on SDLT
              avoidance schemes. While there are still some legitimate ways to
              mitigate your exposure to SDLT, it is an area in which you really
              need to seek advice from appropriately qualified advisers. We're
              here to guide you through the maze.
