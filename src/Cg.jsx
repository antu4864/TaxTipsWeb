        <div className="container">
          <div>
            <p>
              Capital Gains Tax is a tax on the profit made when you sell (or
              'dispose of') something (an 'asset') that has increased in value.
              It is the gain you make that is taxed, not the amount of money you
              receive.
            </p>
            <h3>1. Keep your receipts.</h3>
            <p>
              Keep receipts and records for all assets on which CGT might
              eventually be due. Failure to retain all relevant documentation
              will make it harder to evidence your claim for a tax-allowable
              deduction, should HMRC enquire into your calculations of tax due.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Annual capital gains exemption.</h3>
            <p>
              Married couples or civil partners each have an individual annual
              capital gains allowance, whereby the first £12,300 (£12,300,
              2020/21) of taxable gain is tax-free.
              <br />
              <br />
              By transferring an asset into joint names (with a spouse or civil
              partner), you can make use of two tax-free allowances, so that up
              to £24,600 (£24,600, 2020/21) of any chargeable gain can be
              tax-free.
              <br />
              <br />
              Note: A transfer to your spouse or partner must be a genuine
              outright gift.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Chattels (personal property).</h3>
            <p>
              Paintings, antiques, and other collectibles can be a tax-efficient
              investment, especially where they are not treated as a set and so
              can be sold piece-by-piece, with each item qualifying for a £6,000
              chattel's exemption.
            </p>
            <h3>4. Claim Private Residence Relief to pay less</h3>
            <p>
              If you have lived for a time in a property as your main home
              before letting it out, you can potentially reduce the CGT bill
              when you eventually come to sell it.
            </p>
            <h3>5. Unmarried partners nominate to double-up on relief.</h3>
            <p>
              Unmarried partners can each nominate a different home as their
              main home to get tax relief on both. Married couples and civil
              partners must choose just one, however.
            </p>
