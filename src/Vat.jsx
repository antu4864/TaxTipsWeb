              VAT is a tax on consumption. It applies to most goods and services
              that are bought and sold for use or consumption in the UK.
              <br />
              <br />
              The standard rate is 20% (2020/21), chargeable on most goods and
              services. There is also a 5% 'reduced rate', covering a limited
              range of goods and services, as well as a nil-rate applied to such
              things as essential food and children's clothing.

              <h3>Reduced rate of VAT</h3>
              In July 2020 the government announced a temporary 5% reduced rate
              of VAT applicable to certain supplies relating to:
              <br />
              <br />
              • Hospitality
              <br />
              <br />
              • Hotel and holiday accommodation
              <br />
              <br />
              • Admissions to certain attractions
              <br />
              <br />
              The temporary reduced rate applies to supplies that were made
              between 15 July 2020 and 31 March 2021.
              <br />
              <br />
              In the March 21 Budget, the government UK government announced to
              extend the temporary reduced rate of VAT of 5% until 30 September
              2021 and a new rate of 12.5% from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022.
              <h3>1. Recover VAT on your mileage claims.</h3>
              Many business owners, especially those who own limited companies,
              will claim mileage to cover their business motor expenses,
              typically at a rate of 45p, or 20p, per mile.
              <br />
              <br />
              However, many are unaware that it is possible to claim VAT back on
              the fuel element of these mileage claims (if you are
              VAT-registered).
              <h3>2. Choose the right VAT scheme for your business.</h3>
              There are numerous VAT schemes that your business could benefit
              from. For example, depending on the relevant industry sector, you
              may benefit by being on the flat rate VAT scheme. <br />
              <br />
              Under the flat rate scheme, VAT is simply calculated as a
              percentage of your gross sales (e.g. 12.5% for catering
              businesses). As well as being simple to calculate, you may also
              pay less to HMRC.
              <h3>3. Recover VAT associated with bad debts.</h3>
              If your business accounts for its VAT on the accruals basis and it
              has a customer's debt which has been outstanding for more than six
              months, it could be possible to reclaim any output (sales) VAT
              already paid to HM Revenue & Customs.
              <h3>4. Slow down your VAT payments.</h3>
              If most of your business outputs (sales) are made on account, it
              might be better to account for any VAT due using the cash
              accounting scheme. This is where, subject to certain conditions,
              you do not include VAT from a sale on your VAT returns until your
              customers have paid you, or you do not include the VAT from
              purchases until you have paid for them.
              <h3>5. Always use good software.</h3>
              As part of its Making Tax Digital initiative, HMRC is convinced
              that by using cloud-based software, businesses will reduce the
              volume of careless errors and mistakes that they make. <br />
              <br />
              Reduce the risk of errors by adopting user friendly accounting
              software, such as QuickBooks. This should eliminate the risk of
              VAT being declared twice and VAT on late-received invoices not
              being claimed at all. <br />
              <br />
              It will also make it much easier for your accountant to review
              your VAT returns prior to filing.
