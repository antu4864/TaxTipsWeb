              Deferring Income Tax payments
            </h3>
            <p>
              In response to the COVID-19 crisis early in 2020, the Chancellor
              announced support for the self-employed by deferring the
              requirement for them to make their July 31 (2020) self-assessment
              tax payments for six months to 31 January 2021.
              <br />
              <br />
              Originally Taxpayers were given until 31 January 2021 to pay the
              amount deferred.
              <br />
              <br />
              During Autumn 2020 a further concession was announced to help
              those who might otherwise struggle to pay within the original
              timeframe. Where a Taxpayer considers they will have trouble
              paying the deferred tax they may set up a Time to Pay installment
              arrangement with HMRC.
            </p>
            <h3>Note:</h3>
            <p>
              Interest, not penalties will be chargeable on deferred amounts.
            </p>
            <h3>1. Tax-free savings.</h3>
            <p>
              Putting money into an Individual Savings Account, an ISA, is a way
              of putting money away for the future within a tax-free wrapper.
              <br />
              <br />
              Each tax year you are entitled to a new ISA allowance. The 2021/22
              allowance is £20,000.
              <br />
              <br />
              There are a variety of ISAS; from cash to stocks and shares and
              even junior ISAS. The 2021/22 Junior ISA allowance is £9,000.
              <br />
              <br />
              You can also save into an Innovative Finance ISA or Lifetime ISA.
              <br />
              <br />
              While closed to new entrants from November 2019, it is possible to
              save towards your own home using a Help to Buy ISA. The Government
              will boost your savings by 25%. So, for every £200 you save, you
              receive a government bonus of £50. The maximum government bonus
              you can receive is £3,000.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Pension funding.</h3>
            <p>
              Contributions paid into an employer's pension scheme (including
              any additional voluntary contributions you make) can be made from
              your gross pay, before any tax is charged.
              <br />
              <br />
              For every £1 that you pay into a personal pension, the government
              will contribute another 25p. What's more, if you pay tax above the
              basic rate, you might be entitled to claim additional tax relief
              via your tax code or self-assessment.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Check your tax code.</h3>
            <p>
              Check your tax code each year. If you're on the wrong code, you
              may be paying too little or worse too much tax.
            </p>
            <h3>4. Low taxable income, use your £5,000 savings allowance.</h3>
            <p>
              If the income from your job or pension is below the £12,570
              (£12,500, 2020/21) personal allowance, but you earn income through
              The interest on savings, you can qualify for the savings
              allowance. Interest of up to £5,000 is paid free of income tax in
              addition to your personal allowance, meaning that you could earn
              as much as £17,570 (£17,500, 2020/21) before you start paying
              tax.,
              <br />
              The Marriage Allowance is only available if the highest earner is
              a 20% taxpayer. No transfer is possible if one or the other
              partner is taxed at 40% or above.
            </p>
            <h3>6. High Income Child Benefit Tax Charge</h3>
            <p>
              The High Income Child Benefit Charge (HICBC) is a tax charge paid
              by taxpayers which seek to claw back up to 100% of any child
              benefit received by a higher earner or their partner.
              <br />
              <br />
              HICBC is only payable when the income of the benefit claimant or
              their partner exceeds £50,000 p.a.
              <br />
              <br />
              • HICBC is collected under Self-Assessment.
              <br />
              <br />• Where the taxable income exceeds £60,000 the effect of the
              charge is that all Child Benefit paid is repaid.
            </p>
            <h3>Election</h3>
            <p>
              An election may be made not to receive child benefits. Once made,
              the HICBC will no longer apply
              <br />
              <br />
              It is only worthwhile making the election if the adjusted net
              income of any partner is in excess of £60,000.
            </p>
            <h3>Note:</h3>
            <p>
              Taxpayers affected by the HICBC are required to register for SA
              and pay their HICBC by 31 January following the end of the tax
              year.
              <br />
              <br />
              • You can choose not to get Child Benefit payments, but you should
              still fill in the Child Benefit claim form.
              <br />
              <br />
              • To ensure that:
              <br />
              <br />
              You get National Insurance credits towards your State Pension if
              you are on a low income.
              <br />
              <br />
              Your child is automatically issued a National Insurance number at
              age 16.
