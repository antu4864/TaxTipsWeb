      \n              <p>Capital allowances concern the write-off for tax purposes of expenditure on capital items such as fixed assets (computers, desks, machinery). The rate of write-off against taxable profits is determined by government policy.</p>\n            <p>Under certain circumstances, you may be able to write off the entire cost of your capital expenditure against your taxable profits in the year of purchase. For example, if you are a small business that has acquired new computers.</p>\n                 <h3>There should always be a commercial reason.</h3>\n                 <p>Only spend money to acquire an asset for your business if there is a genuine commercial need.</p>\n                 <h3>Timing is everything.</h3>\n                 <p>If there is a genuine commercial need for a new fixed asset, you can access the funds required for a purchase and you can put it to use as soon as it is acquired. It is best to acquire the asset before the end of one accounting period, rather than to defer the decision until the start of the next.</p>\n                 <p>Even if you only hold an asset for a short period before the end of an accounting period, you will be able to start immediately writing off the asset - thereby lowering your taxable profits in the current year.</p>\n                <h3>Sometimes you may even be able to claim a 100% write-off.</h3>\n                <p>Expenditure on plant and machinery attracts a 100% first-year allowance, which means you can deduct the full cost of the asset from your business's profit, no matter how much it has cost.</p>\n                <h3>Super deduction</h3>\n                <p>For capital expenditure incurred from 1 April 2021 until the end of March 2023, companies can claim 130% capital allowances on qualifying plant and machinery investments.<br/><br/>\n                Under the super-deduction, for every pound a company invests, their taxes are cut by up to 25p.</p>\n                <h3>Annual Investment Allowance (AIA)</h3>\n                <p>The 100% AIA amount for expenditure on plant and machinery (P&M) was temporarily increased from £200,000 to £1 million from 1 January 2019. It was due to decrease to £200,000 from January 202. However, in November 2020 it was announced that to stimulate investment in UK manufacturing and support business confidence, the £1 million annual allowances would remain in place until 1 January 2022.</p>\n                  <h3>Who can claim AIA?</h3>\n                  <p>The allowance is open to many entities so long as their business activity meets one of the following criteria: trading; commercial property letting; office employment; or leasing.<br/><br/>\n                    AIAs are not available to mixed partnerships (that is, partnerships comprised of both individuals and companies).</p>\n                    <h3>Structures and Buildings Allowance</h3>\n                    A new Structures and Buildings Allowance (SBA) has been introduced for qualifying expenditure incurred on or after 29 October 2018.<br/><br/>\n                    The relief is available from when the structure or building is brought into use for the first time for a qualifying activity.<br/><br/>\n                    From April 2020 the rate of allowance has been 3%.<br/><br/>\n                    The allowance is given on a straight-line basis for 50 years.

It applies to most goods and services\n              that are bought and sold for use or consumption in the UK.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              The standard rate is 20% (2020/21), chargeable on most goods and\n              services. There is also a 5% 'reduced rate', covering a limited\n              range of goods and services, as well as a nil-rate applied to such\n              things as essential food and children's clothing.\n              <h3>Help with the COVID-19 emergency</h3>\n              <h3>Deferring VAT payments</h3>\n              Businesses who deferred VAT payments at the start of the pandemic\n              are entitled to apply via the online VAT Deferral New Payment\n              Scheme to pay what the owe in smaller monthly instalments.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              Applicants will be given the option to pay their deferred VAT in\n              equal consecutive monthly instalments from March 2021.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              Businesses will need to opt-in to the new scheme by the 21 June\n              2021.\n              <h3>Reduced rate of VAT</h3>\n              In July 2020 the government announced a temporary 5% reduced rate\n              of VAT applicable to certain supplies relating to:\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              • Hospitality\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              • Hotel and holiday accommodation\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              • Admissions to certain attractions\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              The temporary reduced rate applies to supplies that were made\n              between 15 July 2020 and 31 March 2021.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              In the March 21 Budget, the government UK government announced to\n              extend the temporary reduced rate of VAT of 5% until 30 September\n              2021 and a new rate of 12.5% from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022.\n              <h3>1. Recover VAT on your mileage claims.</h3>\n              Many business owners, especially those who own limited companies,\n              will claim mileage to cover their business motor expenses,\n              typically at a rate of 45p, or 20p, per mile.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              However, many are unaware that it is possible to claim VAT back on\n              the fuel element of these mileage claims (if you are\n              VAT-registered).\n              <h3>2. Choose the right VAT scheme for your business.</h3>\n              There are numerous VAT schemes that your business could benefit\n              from. For example, depending on the relevant industry sector, you\n              may benefit by being on the flat rate VAT scheme. <br />\n              <br />\n              Under the flat rate scheme, VAT is simply calculated as a\n              percentage of your gross sales (e.g. 12.5% for catering\n              businesses). As well as being simple to calculate, you may also\n              pay less to HMRC.\n              <h3>3. Recover VAT associated with bad debts.</h3>\n              If your business accounts for its VAT on the accruals basis and it\n              has a customer's debt which has been outstanding for more than six\n              months, it could be possible to reclaim any output (sales) VAT\n              already paid to HM Revenue & Customs.\n              <h3>4. Slow down your VAT payments.</h3>\n              If most of your business outputs (sales) are made on account, it\n              might be better to account for any VAT due using the cash\n              accounting scheme. This is where, subject to certain conditions,\n              you do not include VAT from a sale on your VAT returns until your\n              customers have paid you, or you do not include the VAT from\n              purchases until you have paid for them.\n              <h3>5. Always use good software.</h3>\n              As part of its Making Tax Digital initiative, HMRC is convinced\n              that by using cloud-based software, businesses will reduce the\n              volume of careless errors and mistakes that they make. <br />\n              <br />\n              Reduce the risk of errors by adopting user friendly accounting\n              software, such as QuickBooks. This should eliminate the risk of\n              VAT being declared twice and VAT on late-received invoices not\n              being claimed at all. <br />\n              <br />\n              It will also make it much easier for your accountant to review\n              your VAT returns prior to filing.\n              <h3>Note:</h3>\n              Underneath its simple exterior, VAT is a mass of complexity.
