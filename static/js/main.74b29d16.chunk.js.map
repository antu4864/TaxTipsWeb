Annual capital gains exemption.</h3>\r\n                 <p>Married couples or civil partners each have an individual annual capital gains allowance, whereby the first £12,300 (£12,300, 2020/21) of taxable gain is tax free.<br/><br/>\r\nBy transferring an asset into joint names (with a spouse or civil partner), you can make use of two tax free allowances, so that up to £24,600 (£24,600, 2020/21) of any chargeable gain can be tax free.<br/><br/>\r\nNote: A transfer to your spouse or partner must be a genuine outright gift.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Chattels (personal property).</h3>\r\n<p>Paintings, antiques and other collectables can be a tax-efficient investment, especially where they are not treated as a set and so can be sold piece-by-piece, with each item qualifying for a £6,000 chattel's exemption.</p>\r\n<h3>4. Claim Private Residence Relief to pay less</h3>\r\n<p>If you have lived for a time in a property as your main home before letting it out, you can potentially reduce the CGT bill when you eventually come to sell it.</p>\r\n<h3>5.

Profits generated in\r\n accounting periods starting on or after 1st April 2017 are subject to a 19% Corporation Tax charge.</p>\r\n<h3>Note:</h3>\r\n<p>In March 2021 the Chancellor announced the UK rate of Corporation Tax will increase to 25%, to support the UK post COVID recovery. The increase will not take effect until 2023.<br/><br/>\r\nBusinesses with profits of up to £50,000 will continue to be taxed at 19%.<br/><br/>\r\nA tapered rate will also be introduced for profits above £50,000, so that only businesses with profits of £250,000 or greater will be taxed at the full 25% rate.</p>\r\n<h3>1. Claim for all business expenses.</h3>\r\n<p>It is not uncommon for a director (or employee, for that matter) to spend money on behalf of the business, and to forget or not get around to claiming it back from the company.</p>\r\n<h3>2. Timing is everything.</h3>\r\n<p>If you are planning to invest in capital items for your company, ensure that you get your timing right and that you claim your full capital allowance entitlement.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Owner / manager - remuneration.</h3>\r\n<p>If you are an owner/manager of the company, you can take a combination of salary and dividends out of your business. Your personal circumstances and business performance will dictate the optimum split between salary and dividends that will minimise corporation and personal taxes.</p>\r\n<h3>4. Research and development.</h3>\r\n<p>There are different types of R&D tax relief depending on the size of your company and whether the project has been subcontracted.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nA small and medium sized R&D tax relief scheme is available to those with less than 500 staff and turn over under 100m euros or with a balance sheet value under 86m euros.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nYou may need to include linked companies and partnerships when you I work out if you're a SME.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nSME R&D relief allows companies to:<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• deduct an extra 130% of their qualifying costs from their yearly profit, as well as the normal 100% deduction, to make a total 230% deduction;<br/><br/>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• claim a tax credit if the company is loss making, worth up to 14.5% of the surrenderable loss.<br/><br/>\r\nThe Research and Development Expenditure Credit (RDEC) gets Corporation Tax relief on your company's research and development costs.</p>\r\n<h3>5. Claim your business-related mileage.</h3>\r\n<p>If you use your private car for trips that are 100% business-related, you can recover the cost of your mileage - either from your company, or against your end-of-year income tax liability using HMRC's authorised mileage rates.<br/><br/>\r\nWhere your company provides you with a car but expects you to pay for all of the fuel used, and where you use your company car for trips that are 100% business related, you can claim the cost of your fuel consumed either from your company or against your end-of-year income tax liability using HMRC's advisory. mileage rates.</p>\r\n<h3>Note:</h3>\r\n<p>Corporation Tax is complex.

Where a Taxpayer considers they will have trouble paying the deferred tax they may set up a Time to Pay instalment arrangement with HMRC.</p>\r\n<h3>Note:</h3>\r\n<p>Interest not penalties will be chargeable on deferred amounts.</p>\r\n<h3>1. Tax-free savings.</h3>\r\n<p>Putting money into an Individual Savings Account, an ISA, is a way of putting money away for the future within a tax-free wrapper.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nEach tax year you are entitled to a new ISA allowance. The 2021/22 allowance is £20,000.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of ISAS; from cash to stocks and shares and even junior ISAS. The 2021/22 Junior ISA allowance is £9,000.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nYou can also save into an Innovative Finance ISA or Lifetime ISA.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nWhile closed to new entrants from November 2019, it is possible to save towards your own home using a Help to Buy ISA. The Government will boost your savings by 25%. So, for every £200 you save, you receive a government bonus of £50. The maximum government bonus you can receive is £3,000.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>2. Pension funding.</h3>\r\n<p>Contributions paid into an employer's pension scheme (including any additional voluntary contributions you make) can be made from your gross pay, before any tax is charged.<br/><br/>\r\nFor every £1 that you pay into a personal pension, the government will contribute another 25p. What's more, if you pay tax above the basic rate, you might be entitled to claim additional tax relief via your tax code or self-assessment.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>3. Check your tax code.</h3>\r\n<p>Check your tax code each year. If you're on the wrong code, you may be paying too little or worse too much tax.</p>\r\n<h3>4. Low taxable income, use your £5,000 savings allowance.</h3>\r\n<p>If the income from your job or pension is below the £12,570 (£12,500, 2020/21) personal allowance, but you earn income through interest on savings, you can qualify for the savings allowance. Interest of up to £5,000 is paid free of income tax in addition to your personal allowance, meaning that you could earn as much as £17,570 (£17,500, 2020/21) before you start paying tax.,<br/>\r\nThe Marriage Allowance is only available if the highest earner is a 20% taxpayer. No transfer is possible if one or the other partner is taxed at 40% or above.</p>\r\n<h3>6. High Income Child Benefit Tax Charge</h3>\r\n<p>The High Income Child Benefit Charge (HICBC) is a tax charge paid by taxpayers which seeks to claw back up to 100% of any child benefit received by a higher earner or their partner.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nHICBC is only payable when the income of the benefit claimant or their partner exceeds £50,000 p.a.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n• HICBC is collected under Self-Assessment.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n• Where taxable income exceeds £60,000 the effect of the charge is that all Child Benefit paid is repaid.</p>\r\n<h3>Election</h3>\r\n<p>An election may be made not to receive child benefit. Once made, the HICBC will no longer apply.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIt is only worthwhile making the election if the adjusted net income of any partner is in excess of £60,000.</p>\r\n<h3>Note:</h3>\r\n<p>Taxpayers affected by the HICBC are required to register for SA and pay their HICBC by 31 January following the end of the tax year.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n• You can choose not to get Child Benefit payments, but you should still fill in the Child Benefit claim form.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n• To ensure that:<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nYou get National Insurance credits towards your State Pension if you are on a low income.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nYour child is automatically issued a National Insurance number at age 16.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nNavigating your way around the complexity of UK tax is challenging.

The NICs that you pay can earn you the right to receive certain benefits.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThere are currently four different classes on national insurance.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe class of NICs you pay is dependent upon whether you are employed, self-employed, or making voluntary contributions.</p>\r\n<h3>1. National Insurance for the self-employed.</h3>\r\n<p>Class 2 NICs are calculated on the number of full, or partial, weeks of self-employment in a given tax year where your profits for that tax year equal or exceed the £6,515 Small Profits Threshold (£6,475, 2020/21).<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nA flat rate of £3.05 per week (£3.05, 2020/21) is payable in one lump sum no later than 31 January following the tax year concerned.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nWhere your profits are below the Small Profits Threshold, and where there is a risk that you may not have made enough NICs to guarantee that you will receive a full state pension upon retirement, it could be advisable to make Class 2 NICS - even though you would be otherwise entitled to claim an exemption.<br/><br/>\r\nPaying class 2 NICS is a cheaper way to ensure that you maintain your State Pension entitlement than opting to pay Class 3 voluntary NICS.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nClass 4 NICs are paid by the self-employed on net profits that are subject to income tax.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nClass 4 NICs are payable at a rate of 9% on profits between the Lower Profits Limit of £9,568 (£9,500, 2019/20) and Upper Profits Limit £50,270 (£50,000, 2020/21) and 2% on profits above £50,000 (£50,000, 2020/21).    </p>\r\n<h3>2. Going abroad to work?</h3>\r\n<p>If you are going abroad to work, you can elect to pay Class 2 NICs. That way, you get the same State Pension entitlement as if though you were paying Class 3 NICs (see below), but at a fraction of the cost.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nBefore deciding whether to pay NICS voluntarily, you should make sure that there are gaps in your NI record for which payment can be made to enhance your State Pension Entitlement.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIf you are unsure about any gaps in your National Insurance record, speak to us as we can advise on what is best for you.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Voluntary contributions</h3>\r\n<p>You may be able to pay Class 3 voluntary National Insurance to fill gaps in your contributions record to qualify for benefits like the State Pension.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nClass 3 NICs are charged at a rate of £15.40 (£15.30, 2020/21) per week and are normally paid quarterly within the tax year concerned.\r\n\r\n<h3>Before you pay</h3>\r\n\r\nCheck your National Insurance record to find out:\r\n\r\nif you have any gaps;\r\n\r\nif you're eligible to pay voluntary contributions; and\r\n\r\n• how much it will cost.\r\n\r\n<h3>Note:</h3>\r\n\r\nNavigating your way around the complexity of UK tax and National Insurance rules is challenging.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nFor more information, contact us before making any\r\n\r\ndecisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n</div> \r\n</>\r\n);\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Ni;","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nconst Pen=() => {\r\n  return (\r\n    \r\n   <>\r\n  \r\n    <div className=\"container1\">\r\n    <h2>Pensions</h2>\r\n        <div className=\"container\">\r\n          <div>\r\n<p>A pension is a long-term tax-efficient savings plan - a way to save money during your working life to help fund you in your retirement.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIt is just a tax-free pot of cash you, your employer (and sometimes the Government) pays into, as a way of saving up for your retirement. At retirement, you can draw money from your pension pot or sell the cash to an insurance company in return for a regular income until death, called an annuity.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nSome pension schemes are run by employers; others you can manage yourself. You can even save into more than one pension scheme at the same time.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, if you are a UK-resident taxpayer under the age of 75, you can contribute to your pension as much as you earn each year, up to the annual allowance of £40,000.<br/><br/>\r\nIf you are not earning enough to pay income tax, you can still receive tax relief on pension contributions up to a maximum of £3,600 a year.</p>\r\n<h3>Tax relief</h3>\r\n<p>You can get tax relief on private pension contributions up to 100% of your annual earnings.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nYou get the tax relief automatically if:<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n• Your employer takes workplace pension contributions out of your pay before deducting Income Tax.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n• You pay tax at 20% where your pension provider claims a tax credit and adds it to your pension pot ('relief at source').</p>\r\n<h3>Additional tax relief in England, Wales and Northern Ireland:</h3>\r\n<p>You can claim additional tax relief under Self Assessment, of:<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n• A further 20% if you pay Income Tax at 40%.<br/><br/>\r\n • A further 25% if you pay Income Tax at 45%.\r\n\r\n<h3>Additional tax relief in relief in Scotland</h3>\r\n\r\nYou can claim additional tax relief under Self Assessment, of:<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n• 1% if you pay Income Tax at 21%.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n• 21% if you pay Income Tax at 41%.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n• 26% if you pay Income Tax at 46%.\r\n\r\n<h3>Note:</h3>\r\n• If your rate of Income Tax in Scotland is 19% your pension provider will still claim tax relief for you at a rate of 20%, you do not need to repay the difference.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n• You get relief at source in all personal and stakeholder pensions, and some workplace pensions.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n• UK tax relief is also available on contributions made\r\n\r\nto certain types of overseas pension schemes.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIf you're getting tax relief on pension contributions worth more than 100% of your annual earnings. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) can ask you to pay back anything over this limit.\r\n\r\n<h3>Lifetime allowance for pension savings</h3>\r\n\r\nThe lifetime allowance is a limit on the value of pay outs from your pension scheme, whether lump sums or retirement income, that can be made without triggering an extra tax charge.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIt applies to the total of all the pensions you have, including the value of pensions promised through any defined benefit scheme(s) you belong to, but excluding your State Pension.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe standard Lifetime Allowance is indexed annually in line with the Consumer Prices Index (CPI).<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe lifetime allowance for most people is currently £1,073,100.\r\n\r\n<h3>The annual allowance </h3>\r\nThe annual allowance is a limit on the amount that can be contributed to your pension each year, while still receiving tax relief. It's based on your earnings for the year and is capped at £40,000.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIt applies across all of the schemes you belong to and includes all contributions that you or your employer or anyone else pays on your behalf.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nA lower limit of £4,000 may apply if you have already started accessing your pension.\r\n\r\n<h3>If you exceed the allowance</h3>\r\n\r\nIf you exceed the annual allowance in a year, you won't receive tax relief on any contributions paid that exceed the limit and you will be faced with an annual allowance charge.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe annual allowance charge will be added to the rest of your taxable income for the tax year in question when determining your tax liability.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIf the annual allowance charge is more than £2,000, you can ask your pension scheme to pay the charge from your benefits.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nUnless you have a money purchase annual allowance (MPAA), you may be able to bring forward any unused annual allowances from the previous three tax years, to either reduce your annual allowance charge to a lower amount or reduce the annual allowance charge completely.    \r\n <h3>Changes to the annual allowance - the Money Purchase Annual Allowance (MPAA)</h3> \r\n Introduced in April 2015, the MPAA is currently £4,000<br/><br/>\r\n\r\ngross p.a.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n• The MPAA applies if you have withdrawn more than the 25% tax free pension commencement lump sum.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n• The MPAA only starts to apply from the day after you have taken flexible benefits and so any previous savings are not affected.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n• You cannot bring forward any unused annual allowances from the previous three tax years to warrant a higher contribution than £4,000 towards your defined contribution benefits.\r\n\r\n<h3>The Tapered Annual Allowance</h3>\r\n\r\nThe tapered annual allowance came into force as of 6 April 2016 for high earners.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n• For every £2 of income above £200,000 per annum, £1 of annual allowance will be lost.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n• The maximum reduction will be £36,000 meaning that anyone earning over £240,000 will have their annual allowance capped at £4,000.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n• An income floor will mean the taper will not apply unless the individual's income excluding pension contributions exceeds £200,000 (the threshold income).\r\n <h3>Charges if you exceed the lifetime allowance</h3>  \r\n If the cumulative value of the pay-outs from your pension pots, including the value of the pay-outs from any defined benefit schemes, exceeds the lifetime allowance, there will be a tax on the excess, called the lifetime allowance charge.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe way the charge applies depends on whether you receive the money from your pension as a lump sum or as part of regular retirement income.\r\n\r\n<h3>Lump sums</h3>\r\n\r\nAny amount over your lifetime allowance that you take as a lump sum is taxed at 55%.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nYour pension scheme administrator should deduct the tax and pay it over to HMRC, paying the balance to you.\r\n\r\n<h3>Other points</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Give your children or grandchildren a helping hand.</h3>\r\n\r\nIf you have children, grandchildren, nephews, or nieces, why not take advantage of the UK government's generosity by putting money into their own children's pension?<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nMoney put into a child's pension gets the same tax relief as any other pension. So, even though your child is not a taxpayer, the taxman will add 20% to payments made, up to a maximum £3,600 each tax year (£2,880 of relatives' contributions and £720 in tax relief). \r\n<h3>2. Have you lost track of your pension(s)?</h3>\r\n\r\nMost of us will have worked for a number of employers over the years, and it can be easy to lose track of old pensions. You can find old pensions through the Pension Tracing Service.\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Are you aware of the 2015 Pension Reforms?</h3>\r\n\r\nChanges in April 2015 have removed the need to buy an annuity to provide income until you die, giving access to invest-and-drawdown schemes previously restricted to wealthier savers. The 55 percent 'death tax' on pension pots left invested has also been axed.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThese changes apply to people with 'defined contribution' pensions who invest them in order to receive a pot of money at retirement. They don't apply to those with guaranteed final salary pensions.\r\n\r\n<h3>Note:</h3>\r\n\r\nPersonal pensions are a mine field and the provision of advice is regulated. Talk to us; we will ensure that you get advice from appropriately qualified advisers.  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n</div> \r\n</>\r\n);\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Pen;","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\n\r\nconst Ct=() => {\r\n  return (\r\n    \r\n   <>\r\n   \r\n    <div className=\"container1\">\r\n    <h2>Value Added Tax (VAT)</h2>\r\n        <div className=\"container\">\r\n          <div>\r\n<p>VAT is a tax on consumption. It applies to most goods and services that are bought and sold for use or consumption in the UK.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe standard rate is 20% (2020/21), chargeable on most goods and services. There is also a 5% 'reduced rate', covering a limited range of goods and services, as well as a nil-rate applied to such things as essential food and children's clothing.\r\n\r\n<h3>Help with the COVID-19 emergency</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Deferring VAT payments</h3>\r\n\r\nBusinesses who deferred VAT payments at the start of the pandemic are entitled to apply via the online VAT Deferral New Payment Scheme to pay what the owe in smaller monthly instalments.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nApplicants will be given the option to pay their deferred VAT in equal consecutive monthly instalments from March 2021.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nBusinesses will need to opt-in to the new scheme by the 21 June 2021.\r\n<h3>Reduced rate of VAT</h3>\r\n\r\nIn July 2020 the government announced a temporary 5% reduced rate of VAT applicable to certain supplies relating to:<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n• Hospitality<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n• Hotel and holiday accommodation<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n• Admissions to certain attractions<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe temporary reduced rate applies to supplies that were made between 15 July 2020 and 31 March 2021.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIn the March 21 Budget, the government UK government announced to extend the temporary reduced rate of VAT of 5% until 30 September 2021 and a new rate of 12.5% from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022.\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Recover VAT on your mileage claims.</h3>\r\n\r\nMany business owners, especially those who own limited companies, will claim mileage to cover their business motor expenses, typically at a rate of 45p, or 20p, per mile.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nHowever, many are unaware that it is possible to claim VAT back on the fuel element of these mileage claims (if you are VAT-registered).\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Choose the right VAT scheme for your business.</h3>\r\nThere are numerous VAT schemes that your business could benefit from. For example, depending on the relevant industry sector, you may benefit by being on the flat rate VAT scheme. <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nUnder the flat rate scheme, VAT is simply calculated as a percentage of your gross sales (e.g. 12.5% for catering businesses). As well as being simple to calculate, you may also pay less to HMRC.\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Recover VAT associated with bad debts.</h3>\r\n\r\nIf your business accounts for its VAT on the accruals basis and it has a customer's debt which has been outstanding for more than six months, it could be possible to reclaim any output (sales) VAT already paid to HM Revenue & Customs.\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Slow down your VAT payments.</h3>\r\n\r\nIf most of your business outputs (sales) are made on account, it might be better to account for any VAT due using the cash accounting scheme. This is where, subject to certain conditions, you do not include VAT from a sale on your VAT returns until your customers have paid you, or you do not include the VAT from purchases until you have paid for them.  \r\n<h3>5. Always use good software.</h3>\r\n\r\nAs part of its Making Tax Digital initiative, HMRC is convinced that by using cloud-based software, businesses will reduce the volume of careless errors and mistakes that they make. <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nReduce the risk of errors by adopting user friendly accounting software, such as QuickBooks. This should eliminate the risk of VAT being declared twice and VAT on late-received invoices not being claimed at all. <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIt will also make it much easier for your accountant to review your VAT returns prior to filing.\r\n\r\n<h3>Note:</h3>\r\n\r\nUnderneath its simple exterior, VAT is a mass of complexity. Why not let us do what we are good at by advising you on the best way to comply with HMRC's myriad of VAT regulations - while you concentrate on what you are good at, running a profitable business. We will ensure that you get advice from an\r\n\r\nappropriately qualified adviser.        </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <br/><br/>\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n</div> \r\n</>\r\n);\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Ct;","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\n\r\nconst Ct=() => {\r\n  return (\r\n    \r\n   <>\r\n  \r\n    <div className=\"container1\">\r\n    <h2>Vehicle Benefits</h2>\r\n        <div className=\"container\">\r\n          <div>\r\n<p>The provision of company cars gives rise to taxable 'benefit in kind' forms as well as a charge to Class 1A National Insurance on the value of the car benefit.\r\n <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nYou'll pay tax if you or your family use a company car privately, including for commuting.\r\n <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe tax on the value of the company car will depend on things like how much it would cost to buy and the type of fuel it uses.\r\n <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThis value of the car is reduced if:\r\n <br/><br/>\r\n\r\n• you have it part-time;\r\n <br/><br/>\r\n\r\n• you pay something towards its cost; and/or\r\n <br/><br/>\r\n\r\n• it has low CO2 emissions.\r\n <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIf your employer pays for fuel you use for personal journeys, you'll pay tax on this separately.\r\n\r\n<h3>1.
